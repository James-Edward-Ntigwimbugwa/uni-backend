Key Features:
- Easy to learn and use
- Interpreted language (no compilation needed)
- Object-oriented programming support
- Large standard library
- Cross-platform compatibility

Basic Syntax:
Python uses indentation to define code blocks instead of braces. This makes the code more readable and enforces good programming practices.

Variables in Python:
Variables are created when you assign a value to them. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare variable types.

Example:
name = "John"
age = 25
height = 5.9

Print Statement:
The print() function is used to display output to the console.

Example:
print("Hello, World!")
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old")''',

2. float - Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.5, 0.0)
3. complex - Complex numbers (e.g., 3+4j)

Text Type:
str - String (e.g., "Hello", 'Python', "123")

Boolean Type:
bool - True or False values

Sequence Types:
1. list - Ordered, mutable collection [1, 2, 3]
2. tuple - Ordered, immutable collection (1, 2, 3)
3. range - Sequence of numbers range(0, 10)

Mapping Type:
dict - Key-value pairs {"name": "John", "age": 25}

Set Types:
1. set - Unordered collection of unique items {1, 2, 3}
2. frozenset - Immutable set

Variable Assignment:
Variables are created by assignment and can hold any data type.

Examples:
number = 42
name = "Alice"
is_student = True
grades = [85, 92, 78, 96]

What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or completing a task. Good algorithms are:
- Correct: Produces the right output for all valid inputs
- Efficient: Uses minimal time and space resources
- Clear: Easy to understand and implement

Common Algorithm Categories:
1. Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
2. Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
3. Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's)
4. Dynamic Programming
5. Greedy Algorithms

What are Data Structures?
Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data to enable efficient access and modification.

Linear Data Structures:
- Arrays: Fixed-size sequential collection
- Linked Lists: Dynamic sequential collection
- Stacks: LIFO (Last In, First Out)
- Queues: FIFO (First In, First Out)

Non-Linear Data Structures:
- Trees: Hierarchical structure
- Graphs: Network of connected nodes
- Hash Tables: Key-value mapping

Algorithm Complexity:
We measure algorithm efficiency using Big O notation:
- O(1): Constant time
- O(log n): Logarithmic time
- O(n): Linear time
- O(nÂ²): Quadratic time''',

Basic Concepts:

System: The part of the universe being studied
Surroundings: Everything outside the system
Boundary: The interface between system and surroundings

Types of Systems:
1. Open System: Mass and energy can cross boundaries
2. Closed System: Only energy can cross boundaries
3. Isolated System: Neither mass nor energy can cross boundaries

Properties:
- Intensive Properties: Independent of mass (temperature, pressure)
- Extensive Properties: Dependent on mass (volume, internal energy)

State Functions: Properties that depend only on current state
- Temperature (T)
- Pressure (P)
- Volume (V)
- Internal Energy (U)
- Enthalpy (H)
- Entropy (S)

The Four Laws of Thermodynamics:

Zeroth Law: If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

First Law: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.
ÎU = Q - W
Where: ÎU = change in internal energy, Q = heat added, W = work done by system

Second Law: The entropy of an isolated system never decreases.
Heat flows spontaneously from hot to cold bodies.

Third Law: The entropy of a perfect crystal approaches zero as temperature approaches absolute zero.

Applications:
- Heat engines
- Refrigeration systems
- Power plants
- HVAC systems''',
